# Blueprint

This repository contains [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) config files for building AMIs (customized VM images) and systemd-sysext images for overlaying on top of specific path in a filesystem as an package installation mechanism. It also houses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules that preconfigure and exposes commonly used options to reduce overhead in writing IaC configs
